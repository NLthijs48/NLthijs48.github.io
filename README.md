This repository contains the code used for my personal website.

### Development

-   use `npm start` to run the website locally
-   I use Intellij IDEA for development, some settings are included in the repository
-   the resulting website is hosted using Github Pages

### Used tooling

-   Prettier is used to format all code, it is recommended to run it on-save in your IDE
