		<div>
			Baking bread just-in-time is challenging because it needs time to cool before it can be packaged. If after baking it still needs
			to be moved to a warehouse, then packaged into orders, then moved to all hubs (locations with just delivery vehicles), and
			finally to the customer it takes too long. It would either be too late, or be less fresh than it should be.
			<div style={{marginTop: '0.5em'}}>
				To solve this problem, we created a tool for the baker to directly print shipping labels, combined with product information
				(ingredients and such). This means the bread can directly be brought to the hubs, instead of going to warehouses first.
				Below the main components are described.
